              Our Story
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Deep Fashion Sarsawa was created with a vision to redefine ethnic
              fashion by blending Indian tradition with modern elegance. We noticed
              that many outfits were either too heavy and traditional or too modern
              and disconnected from cultural roots. Our goal was to create a perfect
              balance — designs that carry heritage while feeling refined,
              comfortable, and contemporary.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              What began as a passion for elegant craftsmanship has grown into a
              brand dedicated to celebrating femininity, confidence, and grace.
              Every collection reflects our belief that fashion should feel timeless,
              not temporary.
