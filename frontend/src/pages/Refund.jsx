        2. Return & Refund Policy
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        We maintain a strict return policy to ensure fairness and product quality.
        Returns are accepted ONLY under the following conditions:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>Product received is physically damaged.</li>
        <li>Wrong size delivered (size issue).</li>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">
        Mandatory Condition: Unboxing Video Required
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        To be eligible for return or refund, customers must record a clear,
        continuous, unedited unboxing video starting from the sealed package
        opening until the product is fully shown.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        The video must clearly show:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li>The sealed package before opening</li>
        <li>The full unboxing process</li>
        <li>The damaged area or size issue clearly visible</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Without a proper unboxing video, no return or refund request will be accepted.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Return requests must be raised within 24 hours of delivery via WhatsApp.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4">

        <li>Store credit</li>
        <li>Refund (if applicable and approved)</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Products must be unused, unwashed, and in original condition with tags intact.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 font-semibold">
        We do NOT accept returns for:
